# Aha Coding Interview

I always liked such kind to take home assessments since it not only proves that I have the ability to code, but also I am absolutely keen for the position.

Things I attempted:
- Proper coding structure for the backend.
- Complex queries that handles the data.
- Using (almost) every recommended tool by the team.
- Proper documentation.

Things I did not attempt:
- Making a fancy frontend. Apparently because it will take me a longer time.
- Sticking to the RESTful standard in designing the APIs. Since I have to cater for rendering the html pages.
- Dockerizing my application.

Please forgive my frontend `ejs` codes since I am too lazy to start a React/Next app. I prefer focusing on my Typescript. Thanks you team.
