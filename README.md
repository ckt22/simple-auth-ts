# Aha Coding Interview

I always liked such kind to take home assessments since it not only proves that I have the ability to code, but also I am absolutely keen for the position.

Tech Stack:
- Express (Nodejs, Typescript)
- MySQL
- EJS View Engine

Things I attempted:
- Proper coding structure for the backend. Except that I combined controllers and routes.
- Complex queries that handles the data. Check `queryBuilder.ts`.
- Using almost every recommended tool by the team except for Retool.
- Proper documentation.

Things I did not attempt:
- Making a fancy frontend. Apparently because it will take me a longer time.
- Sticking to the RESTful standard in designing the APIs. Since I have to cater for rendering the html pages.
- Admin-protect the `/user/dashboard` route.
- Dockerizing my application.
