# Aha Coding Interview

I always liked such kind to take home assessments since it not only proves that I have the ability to code, but also I am absolutely keen for the position.

Please forgive my frontend `ejs` codes since I am too lazy to start a React/Next app. I prefer focusing on my Typescript. Thanks you team.
